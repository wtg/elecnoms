# elecnoms

elecnoms is a microservice that handles nominations for the [Elections](https://github.com/wtg/elections) website.

## Why

Nominations are a sufficiently detached section of the Elections site. Much of the Elections API needs to be overhauled, so we're going to start by implementing this new service in Go.

## Documentation

Coming soon.
